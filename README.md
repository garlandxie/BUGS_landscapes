Calculating urban landscape metrics for the BUGS lab @ UTSC

Steps to use the R scripts
1. For personal use on your computer (Mac and Windows), you can download the entire workflow (R scripts and R project) by clicking on the Code button (green) and then clicking on the "Download ZIP" under the Local tab. Afterwards, unzip the folder under a specific directory on your computer. If you're more comfortable with using Git + Git Bash, you can clone this GitHub repo in RStudio using HTTPS or SSH (where SSH is a more secure option).
