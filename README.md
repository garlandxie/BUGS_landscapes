Calculating urban landscape metrics for the BUGS lab @ UTSC

Steps to use the R scripts
1. For personal use on your computer (Mac and Windows), you can download the entire workflow (R scripts and R project) by clicking on the Code button (green) and then clicking on the "Download ZIP" under the Local tab. Afterwards, unzip the folder under a specific directory on your computer. **Note:** If you're more comfortable with using Git + Git Bash, you can also clone this GitHub repo in RStudio using HTTPS or SSH (see Jenny Bryan's excellent ["Happy Git and GitHub for the useR"](https://happygitwithr.com/) for a more detailed workflow).
